                    When I was representing the Russian Federation at a conference, the delegate of the USA
                    introduced himself by saying "I have never been to an MUN before, please don't threaten to
                    nuke or invade my country". I did both.

                    A first time delegate spent his time saying "I know nobody likes the US, but..." and suggesting
                    that if we were trying to find ways to punish nations that did not uphold human rights, we should
                    ask China about their experiences "beating pregnant women with planks". astoundingly enough,
                    he was asked for no formal apologies throughout the conference, and when I note passed to the
                    US asking how he hadn't requested one already, he wrote back with "that's fine, we don't really
                    like ourselves either".
